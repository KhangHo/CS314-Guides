# Installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

If you are running Windows 10 or Windows 11, you have the option of using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Requirements
- Windows install must be 64-bit (`x64`)

## Installing WSL
WSL does not come enabled by default in Windows. You can enable it by:

1. Hit `Win + S` (open search)
2. Type `Turn Windows features on or off` and hit enter
3. Find `Windows Subsystem for Linux` in the listing, and tick the box next to it
4. Click the `OK` button
5. It will install and require a restart before it can be used.

## Installing a Linux Distro to WSL
Now that you have WSL, you can install a distro for it. Use the Microsoft Store app on Windows to install the distro.  
It's recommended that you install [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6) or another Debian-based Linux distro.

## Using WSL
### Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) commandline made for Windows by Microsoft. New versions of Windows 10 and 11 come with Windows Terminal packaged in, but if you do not already have it, be sure to install it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701).

Windows Terminal is how you can use WSL. Open a new Windows Terminal and click the dropdown arrow next to the plus tab button. Select the `Ubuntu` option (or whatever distro you selected) and a new prompt tab should open. Here is where any commands in further guides/instructions would be entered.

### Accessing Home Directory
By default, Windows Terminal may start you out in a `/mnt/c/Users/YourUser` folder. Windows has mounted your regular OS drive to the Linux subsystem for ease of access and use. However, for the Linux-related things we will be doing, we can navigate to our home directory:
```sh
$ cd ~
```
Now, I recommend creating a directory to store your development efforts:
```sh
$ mkdir development
```
In that directory, you can then [clone the repo](../downloading-aka-source-control.md)

## Installing Dependencies
Now, follow the [macOS/Linux installation guide](macos-linux.md). All of the commands should work when executed in WSL.
